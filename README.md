# Okspiel (1ยบ Phase)

Desktop application to handle remotely multiple [Okcash full node wallets](https://github.com/okcashpro/okcash/releases)

## How Okspiel works

For now only is tested in Linux but should work in Mac. In Windows could be not however working for compatibility is part of the Road Map

### Requirements

* Rustup (you can install from here https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
* For now you need to compile [Okcash full node wallet](https://github.com/okcashpro/okcash) from master repository until the version 6.9.0.6 is released  

### Installation

`cargo install okspiel`

### Start the app

execute `okspiel` in you terminal

### Connecting with remote wallet full node

1. Open the okcash config file of your wallet full node where you want to connect
2. Include this:

```
listen=1
server=1
daemon=1
whitelist=[IP_WHERE_IS_THE_OKSPIEL]
rpcallowip=[IP_WHERE_IS_THE_OKSPIEL]
```

## Run test

1. Clone the sources `git clone https://github.com/dancespiele/okspiel.git`

You need to include `.env` in the root folder of your project with the next variables:

```
URL=[Your domain]
ACCOUNT=[Your account name of your wallet]
RPCUSER=[the user of the rpc of your wallet]
RPCPASSWORD=[the password of the rpc of your wallet]
PHRASE=[the phrase of your wallet]
ADDRESS_TO_SEND_TEST_AMOUNT=[address for receiving test transaction]
```

After `.env` file is included, go to okspiel sources with the terminal and execute `cargo test`

**Warning**: there is a test for send transaction that will send a quantity of 0,01 $OK + fees to the address that you set in `ADDRESS_TO_SEND_TEST_AMOUNT`
